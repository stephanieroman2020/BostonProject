There are more than 200,000 students at colleges and universities across the Boston area, with 75% of them attending four-year institutions inside the city limits, from Boston University to Northeastern as noted in the Department of Neighborhood Development, which tracks the Hub’s student population.

Boston has the dreaded move-in period. Every year, new and returning students move into dorms or new apartments near the city’s universities. While move in week is a common occurrence every year, that doesn’t stop the annoyance of dealing with streets flooded with furniture, traffic delays, and extra trash.

The city’s landlords long ago adopted the September-to-September lease cycle, meaning most Boston renters are tied to a schedule that’s just perfect for college students, but miserable for everyone else.

Planning begins as early as June in the Inspectional Services Department, which convenes meetings of its housing, building, environmental sanitation and constituent services staff. City officials also track major sporting events and collaborate with BC, BU and other schools with large student populations to predict the activity around September 1.

With the September 1st move in comes college kids who are ramping up for the year. Please explore the website to show that there is a correlelation between the move in dates of college kids and the highest amount of noise complaints, trash complaints and where trash is so are the extra service calls pertaining to rodents/pests infestations. 

Our project cleans up a 311 service log in Boston and focuses on noise, trash and rodents/pests complaints in each month.
